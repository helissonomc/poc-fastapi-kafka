docker-compose up --build

FOR THIS TO WORK YOU NEED TO REQUEST THE ENDPOINT /consume, SO IT CAN CREATE THEN CONSUMER.

NOTE THAT THE CONSUMER WILL GENERATE A .TXT FILE EVERYTIME THERE IS A NEW EVENT, THE REASON I DID THIS IS TO HAVE
MORE RELIABLE LOGS, THAN JUST PRINTING THINGS IN THE CONSOLE

IF YOU WANT MORE DETAILS ON THE EVENTS, TOPICS, DATA ETC CHECK THIS https://www.conduktor.io/kafka/kafka-topics-cli-tutorial/
YOU CAN SSH INTO THE KAFKA CONTAINER AND RUN AND CHECK DIRECTLY INSIDE KAFKAn THINGS HAPPENING IN REAL TIME
